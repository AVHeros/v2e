    New features
        - Input frames can be generated by python module that is specified on command line, see moving-dot.py for sample

        - Write in place option --output_in_place added to save v2e output in same folder as source video

    Bug fixes
        - Fixed option to specify both --auto_timestamp_resolution and --timestamp_resolution at same time, to limit maximum timestep for DVS events
        - Fixed warning messages to warn users about bad combination of upsampling frame rate and lowpass filtering
        - Fixed subtle timing problems with events that cause some skew for some videos that generate many events per frame
        - Fixed the problem when initializing the first frame that causes a burst of leak events.
