v.1.4.0
    New features
        - Input frames can be generated by python module that is specified on command line, see moving-dot.py for sample
        - Video files output can be suppressed with --skip_video_files
        - Write in place option --output_in_place added to save v2e output in same folder as source video

    Bug fixes
        - Fixed option to specify both --auto_timestamp_resolution and --timestamp_resolution at same time, to limit maximum timestep for DVS events
        - Fixed warning messages to warn users about bad combination of upsampling frame rate and lowpass filtering
        - Fixed subtle timing problems with events that cause some skew for some videos that generate many events per frame
        - Fixed the problem when initializing the first frame that causes a burst of leak events. Set the leak initial state accounting for random pixel ON thresholds.
        - Changed so that DVS parameter selection is by default None, so that user selections are not overridden. Added warning that such options will be overridden by using the --dvs_params option
        --Set default 'noisy' shot noise rate to more realistic 5Hz/pixel value

v1.3.1
 - initial release to accompany the v2e arxiv paper
